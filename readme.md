# Summary of our approach (needs to be edited at the end) #
1. **Planning Single-Cycle RV321 Design**: We looked at our working design of Lab 4 and made note of differences in design to the final project. We then wrote down all the new changes we needed to make and assigned it.
2. **Implementing RV321 Design (For our own machine code)**: We then documented the changes we made, each of us contributing to the writeup of the task we completed. 
3. **Implementing RV321 Design (For Reference Program)**
4. **Implementing Pipelining**

# Planning Single-Cycle RV321 Design #
Looking at the brief and comparing our Lab 4 design with the required project design, we have the following requirements:
* *Coming up with a machine code*
* *Add "Write Multiplexer"* with inputs PC+4 and Result which outputs WD3 (write data of register file). This will be used to write the return address after a jump to the register file, when a jump takes place
* *Changes in Control Unit*
* *Adding Data Memory and Multiplexer*

# Implementing RV321 Design (For Team Code) #
(Note: We will all be working on the main branch for now: PRs and reviews takes a lot of time and it is unneeded at this stage as everyone is working on their individual modules.)
