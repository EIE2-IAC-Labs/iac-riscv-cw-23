# Summary of what I did #
* I was the **main editor** for the team documentation and at times, took the lead as project manager, arranging meetings and setting team deadlines
* **rtl**: Created ALU and RegFile modules. Led the debugging and helped with testbench
* **rtl2**: Debugged the ALU, changed the testbench, helped with debugging the top-level module and helped final testing of new rtl2 design
* **rtl3**: Changed the data memory to include byte and word addressing and led the debugging against the reference code
* **pipelining**: I made the first flip-flop and put everything altogether in the top-level module
* **pipelining2**: I helped change the data memory to include byte and word addressing as well
* **caching**: I helped plan our approach and created the cache_controller module

# Explanations #
During the final year project last year, I led my team as project manager and in turn, editor of our report. I thoroughly enjoyed the role because I like planning and organising. For this coursework I employed the following things I learned from my experience last year:
* Documenting along as we made progress. It was easy to do lots of lab work without documentation but that leads to having a lot of write-up piled up and the writer forgetting things we had done in that session. Thus, by documenting the work as we went, I made it easy for whoever was doing the write-up to just have a small amount to write after that session and be able to write down all the relevant points while it was still fresh on their mind.
* Arranging regular meeting sessions. This served a few purposes. During team projects it was inevitable for a team member to miss sessions so meetings make it easy to keep everyone up to speed with progress and give a chance for healthy discussion. Furthermore, keeping tabs on progression made it far easier to plan and make deadlines.
* Outlining our aims clearly in bullet points so team members knew exactly what the remaining tasks were. This made it easy for me to coordinate our approach.
