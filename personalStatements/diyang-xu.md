### summary list of things I did ###

RTL:
Program Counter ( mainly comes from the lab 4 the default value has been changed to 32'hBFC00000 which is set in the given graph. )And this is helped 
by Hanbo.
Mux1 this part is used to select if the program counter is going to add 4 or going into branch. 
"top-level' file about program counter :
this file is the logic about how program counter and the mux run 
help Hanbo with the top level file.

RTL2:
help pengyuan with the control unit and Hanbo with adding some changes to the top level file ( making sure that all variables are using the same name.)

RTL3: 
Editing the reference program and debuging . Help doing the top level file.

pipelining:
making simple flipflop named flipflop 2 and testing ,debuging the pipelining with the help of Hanbo . Then help changing top level module.

pipelining 2 :
makeing some changes from pipelining 1 with Pengyuan and also did the testing and debuging.

cache:
we did the planing and conctroller together.


### Things I learned ###

Firstly , the most important lesson that I have learned is about the teamwork. Since the coursework has began , I met with other teammates in person and 
allocated the work approprately which significantly increased the efficiency of this project . as a result ,we basically finished the whole work a week 
beforehand. It is much effective to communicate with my team member when encoutntering any problem.

Another thing is that the most difficult part in the whole coursework for me is to debug which I thought would be easy to deal with. It took me even 
shorter time to build the modules , but when testing , the Vbuddy did not act as what I expected, at first it was easy to make some corrections since there
are written errors in the terminal. But as I had fixed all those errors the Vbuddy still did not work, that made me doubt if I made the whole module in a 
wrong way. Thanks to my teammates , we spent a lot of time finding the error and fixed them. And also I learned always asking questions and trying to get
help instead of thinking alone.

Last but not least, I learn how to use Github. I have heared that Github is a powerful website for programing learners , but never deeply learned how to 
use it until my group mates Hanbo and Anish teached me about how to push and pull thing to the repository and my Macbook, how to make branch and so on, 
which enhance my confidence to learn programing and computer architecture well.
